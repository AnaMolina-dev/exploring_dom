DOM <br>
 Technical Exploration Route<br>
ðŸŽ¯ OBJECTIVE<br>
Understand the DOM, how to change things using JavaScript, and how to make forms safer for users. Weâ€™re not aiming for perfectionâ€”just to explore, test, and share what we discover.<br>
ðŸ”” IMPORTANT<br>
You donâ€™t have to complete all the challenges<br>
You can ask for help anytime or work individually, in pairs, or in small groupsâ€”whatever makes you feel comfortable.<br>
Take breaks whenever you need.<br>
ðŸ§­ CHALLENGE 1: Explore the DOM (Document Object Model) Choose the option you like best or feel most comfortable with. You donâ€™t need to do all three<br>
ðŸ§­ CHALLENGE 2: Letâ€™s play with changing things Goal: Make a button greet you.<br>
ðŸ§­ CHALLENGE 3: Explore a form with basic JavaScript validations ðŸŽ¯ Goal: See how a form works with built-in JavaScript validation. Editable, modifiable, and safe to experiment with.<br>
ðŸ§­ EXTREME CHALLENGE 4: Make your form think for itself ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Create a form that validates all fields using only JavaScriptâ€”no required, no type="email.<br>
